## Project Name: Finance Tracker
## Project Description: Many struggle with tracking their income, savings, and expenses while also not being able to manage their financial goals which can lead to overspending. Finance Tracker will track peopleâ€™s income and expenses. Our program will also help people by setting a budget plan that will reduce financial stress by helping people take control of their finances. It will also send alerts when the budget you set has been exceeded. There will be different available methods of notifications that users can choose from such as email, SMS, and WhatsApp. Users will be able to select through various categories they want to focus their budgeting goals on.

## Docker Overview

Docker allows us to containerize the Java app.  
We created a Dockerfile that uses the `openjdk:23` image, copies compiled code, and runs it with `java Main`.  
To build the image: `docker build -t hello-java .`  
To run the app in a container: `docker run hello-java`
